# Code files from "Python Workout"

My book, "Python Workout" (https://PythonWorkout.com/) contains 50 exercises that help to improve your Python fluency.  This repository contains the code and solutions to those exercises, including all of the "beyond the exercise" additional, bonus exercises.

The main exercises have "pytest" tests, while the "beyond" exercises don't.
